# Decision-tree-in-apple-stock-prediction

# Description and Background:  

The main problem faces people who work in stock market the huge loses when the prices decrease and drop. They lose a huge amount of money. The main purpose of the company is to avoid and prevent this huge loses by predicting a current period of time in the future to help the owner or the decision maker to take the best decision about their business in stock market. 

# Dataset: 

In this case, The Company predicted the next 30 days of the prices of the apple stock market. So, we used a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/   to use it in prediction. 

# Proposed Technical Approach or Solution:  

The company used the data science to solve the problem. It solve the problem by using linear regression model and decision tree regression model by analyzing data to split  75% of the past prices for (training) and 25% test. Then use python library (sklearn.tree) to import decision tree regression and (sklearn.linear_model) to import linear regression model. Then use the variable of future days to detect the period you need to predict in future.
